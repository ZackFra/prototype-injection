triune, and evoked by the strength of their spell\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dark hell, and the mountain of anguish, and heaven that was hollower and harder than hell.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These are not: the womb of the darkness that bare them rejects them, and knows them no more:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thought, fettered in misery and iron, revives in the light that it lived in of yore.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the soul that is wisdom and freedom, the spirit of England redeemed from her past,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speaks life through the lips of the master and lord of her children, the first and the last.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thought, touched by his hand and redeemed by his breath, sees, hears, and accepts from above\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The

weapons,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eyes fixed on the open door whence swiftly came\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Savage warriors rushing madly on their prey.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fell the foremost dead; a second leaped and fell;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Halted all at smell of powder, sight of smoke,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turned and fled with superstitions dread o'er-come.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speedily arrived the sailors and the soldiers\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith had summoned.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At his word a guard detailed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Watched the Indians while they carried to the barge\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Baskets piled with corn, provisions dearly bought.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Here will we rest till morning dawns,\" the Captain said,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In this outpost rude well wait the rising of the tide,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Russell, comrade brave, and West, and Percy, too,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stay with me, a guard at door; the rest away!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corn to watch, the stranded barge, the pinnace there.\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Round the open fire they sat them down awhile--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On such gruesome night they had no thought for sleep.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Powhatan now sent a present to the Captain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bracelet to appease the fiery White Man's wrath;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soon some Indians came to bring them venison,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feast they much enjoyed despite their secret doubts.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarce had natives left when through the cabin door\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pocahontas stepped with wild-eyed countenance,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wrung her hands and cried, \"Beware the Powhatans!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seek your ships; my people plot your lives to take--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Would you live, begone from here, no more delay!\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her tears brave Pocahontas could no longer stay.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uprose Smith, advanced in haste to greet the maid--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Guardian Angel! fear not for the White Men's lives;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We will heed your warning; it is not in vain;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With these guns and swords we're safe until the dawn,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with high tide will our men and ships depart.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stay not thou, I pray, since peril lurks for thee,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friend of White Man! to thy teepee hie thee back,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wait and watch and pray, as we shall surely do,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till the night shall pass and come the break of day.\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fare-thee-well, Great Spirit guard thee, Friends!\" she cried--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Back to the Indian village Pocahontas fled.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite her warning and their dread, the Red Men came not;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For they feared the wakeful foe, the magic guns,--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kept in hiding for the time.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At faintest dawn\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0English sought the pinnace, homeward made their way.\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VI.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE PARTING.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the meadow by the brooklet was the wigwam\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the old squaw, Winganameo, who to Matoax\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From her childhood oft had taught the folklore,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tales of olden days beside the roaring ocean\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the White Man's ships were wrecked beside the beach,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where through pine woods roamed at will the stalwart Red Men--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accomacks and Chesapeacks and Potomekes,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tappahannocks,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wangoags,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Payankatankas,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the giants of the North, Sasquesahannocks,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the Roanoaks from the magnolia Southlands.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How they fought and how they were united,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How the Powhatan his mighty rule extended--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All these things the old squaw told the maiden.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the mimosa sat Matoax often,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While she listened to the old squaw's wondrous tales,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0learned from her to trace the beadwork patterns deftly\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the moccasins or on the women's mantles;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But of all the stories Winganameo told her,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None the maiden loved to hear so oft repeated\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the legend of the lost ones of Croatan,[8]\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the island where the blue-eyed children lived.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus it was that Pocahontas heard of English\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long before she looked upon the strange Pale Faces,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dreamed of them as little lower than the angels,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the wisdom of the ages blessed.\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Refers to the \"Lost Colony of Roanoke, 1587,\" (see Hawk's History of North Carolina).\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the wigwam by the brooklet came the Princess\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oft at evening; told to Winganameo softly\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How the English called her \"Guardian Angel,\" loved her,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gave her presents, daily asked her to their homes.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Winganameo nodded sagely as she listened,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she spoke a word of warning to the Princess:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Let not Pale Face bring unto you sorrow, Matoax;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a mother I have watched you coming, going,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Princess born, 'tis many a warrior would wed you,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better could you find a male among your own;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Pale Face is not of us, is a stranger;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though he love you, he will leave you for his people,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And his home beyond the sea.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have seen it,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often have I seen it, watched him sail away\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevermore returning.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heed my words, O, Daughter!\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pocahontas listened, but her lips replied not,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All her heart was mirrored\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in her dreaming eyes,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she sat with folded hands beneath the shadow\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of mimosa branches with their pink-hued blossoms\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making fairy canopy above her head.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While they sat together in the twilight hour\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Came to them a messenger direct from Jamestown,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indian hunter, many a mile he'd walked to tell\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To his people that the Wizard brave lay wounded\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unto death within his cabin, nursed by soldiers\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who would take him soon across the sea to England.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pocahontas heard the tidings, listening quiet,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But with bated breath--spoke to Winganameo,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saying, \"We must go, mayhap the Captain needs us.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the old squaw whispered back to her in following,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Unto Jamestown we will go together, Daughter.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So they journeyed onward through the field and forest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the silver moonbeams fitful shadows made\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On their pathway, till they reached the settlers' country,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saw the palisades and houses of the English.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Father,\" cried the Princess, kneeling by the bedside\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the sometime President, who suffering lay--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Art thou wounded sore, and is it true they say\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That to England thou must go, or life's in danger?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Winganameo comes to nurse thee at my bidding,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She the old squaw of my people hath much knowledge,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many wounded, sick to death has helped to cure--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must thou go across the distant waters, Father?\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarcely had the wounded Captain strength to answer,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he feebly placed his hand upon her head,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Child, 'tis true indeed, that I am past your aid,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And must seek for London surgery, since the wound\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From explosion of the powder festers sore;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hence I leave our well-loved colony for England--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I live I'll come again unto Virginia.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pocahontas! first as little maid I saw thee,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Into noble womanhood I've watched thee growing,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Few and fleeting are the years we've known each other,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou hast ever been the White Man's loyal friend.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep the trust I give thee with my parting blessing.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still defend these homes, make peace among thy people,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0God reward thee, Princess, in the days to come.\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fainter grew his breath from pain, the watching soldiers\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Motioned her away, she turned from them in silence,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Followed by the old squaw, glided from the cabin.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tears came not that day, despair was in her heart,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dark the future to the lonely Indian maid.\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VII.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0POCAHONTAS AND JOHN ROLFE.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swiftly passed two years; the colony was saved\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From dire ruin by Lord Delaware's arrival\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With supplies and words of cheer, with thankful prayers\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unto heaven for rescue from the \"Starving Time.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Indians had resentful grown meanwhile,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pocahontas long had vanished from their ken,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Said the settlers questioned of the Princess' fate.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once again the colonists took courage, throve\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Neath the strong rule of \"High Marshall\" Thomas Dale.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Argall bold began to open trade once more\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the tribes; the Potomekes he cruised among,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Learned from them that Pocahontas was their guest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bribed a squaw to bring her to the waiting ship,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carried her away to Jamestown as a hostage--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not unwilling hostage to the English race,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which she loved, though weaned from her childhood's ardor.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Day by day she came and went among the settlers\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a noiseless step, with gentle courtesy\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That soon won for her the friendship of her captors.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Children loved her, played with her among the flowers\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Growing wild in woodland and in meadows;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she wove them flower baskets of the rushes\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the shallow pools within the wide brown marshes.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oftener she sat beside the open doorway\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With her beadwork, and her skilful fingers plying\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deftly back and forth upon the wooden frame,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fashioned wondrous patterns of the brightest colors\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the moccasins and dresses of the women.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was thus that Rolfe, the English planter saw her,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the picture of the maiden at her beadwork\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Haunted long his memory as he sat alone\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the home bereft of woman's love and care.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long he mused and sadly on his mournful fortunes\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the fateful shipwreck on Bermuda's shore\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That had left him lonely, left a gloomy shadow\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On his New World home.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then he broke the silence:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Others who have loved and lost to grief consent not.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rouse them from their sorrow unto nobler purpose.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well I know that melancholy claims the captive,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marks the trembling hostage for its own--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often have I seen her steal away at twilight\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the cabin rude where once he lived, her hero,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where of yore his voice had welcomed her in greeting;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or again, when none is by to watch her mourning\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the old days when she roamed a princess free,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I myself have overheard her quiet weeping.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She is lonely, needs a strong arm to protect her--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dare I then, a Saxon, wed an Indian

o'erlay;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Azalea-boughs half rosy and half white\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shine through the green and clustering apple-spray,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such as the fairy-queen before her knight\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Waved in old story, luring him away\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where round lost isles Hesperian billows break\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or towers loom up beneath the clear, translucent lake;\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And under the deep grass blue hare-bells hide,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And myrtle plots with dew-fall ever wet,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gay tiger-lilies flammulate and pied,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometime on pathway borders neatly set,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now blossom through the brake on either side,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where heliotrope and weedy mignonette,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With vines in bloom and flower-bearing trees,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mingle their incense all to swell the perfumed breeze,\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That sprung like Hermes from his natal cave\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In some blue rampart of the curving West,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comes up the valleys where green cornfields wave,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ravels the cloud about the mountain crest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breathes on the lake till gentle ripples pave\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Its placid floor; at length a long-loved guest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He steals across this plot of pleasant ground,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Waking the vocal leaves to a sweet vernal sound.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here many a day right gladly have I sped,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Content amid the wavy plumes to lie,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And through the woven branches overhead\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Watch the white, ever-wandering clouds go by,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And soaring birds make their dissolving bed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Far in the azure depths of summer sky,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or nearer that small huntsman of the air,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fly-catcher, dart nimbly from his leafy lair;\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pillowed at ease to hear the merry tune\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of mating warblers in the boughs above\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And shrill cicadas whom the hottest noon\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keeps not from drowsy song; the mourning dove\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pours down the murmuring grove his plaintive croon\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That like the voice of visionary love\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oft have I risen to seek through this green maze\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Even as my feet thread now the great world's garden-ways);\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, parting tangled bushes as I passed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Down beechen alleys beautiful and dim,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps by some deep-shaded pool at last\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My feet would pause, where goldfish poise and swim,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And snowy callas' velvet cups are massed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Around the mossy, fern-encircled brim.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, then, that magic summoning would cease,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or sound far off again among the orchard trees.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And here where the blanched lilies of the vale\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And violets and yellow star-flowers teem,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And pink and purple hyacinths exhale\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Their heavy fume, once more to drowse and dream\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My head would sink, from many an olden tale\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Drawing imagination's fervid theme,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or haply peopling this enchanting spot\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only with fair creations of fantastic thought.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For oft I think, in years long since gone by,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That gentle hearts dwelt here and gentle hands\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stored all this bowery bliss to beautify\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The paradise of some unsung romance;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, safe from all except the loved one's eye,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'Tis sweet to think white limbs were wont to glance,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well pleased to wanton like the flowers and share\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Their simple loveliness with the enamored air.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thrice dear to them whose votive fingers decked\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The altars of First Love were these green ways, - \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These lawns and verdurous brakes forever flecked\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the warm sunshine of midsummer days;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oft where the long straight allies intersect\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And marble seats surround the open space,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where a tiled pool and sculptured fountain stand,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hath Evening found them seated, silent, hand in hand.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When twilight deepened, in the gathering shade\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Beneath that old titanic cypress row,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whose sombre vault and towering colonnade\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dwarfed the enfolded forms that moved below,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oft with close steps these happy lovers strayed,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Till down its darkening aisle the sunset glow\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grew less and patterning the garden floor\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Faint flakes of filtering moonlight mantled more and more.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the strange tempest that a touch imparts\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through the mid fibre of the molten frame,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the sweet flesh in early youth asserts\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Its heyday verve and little hints enflame,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Disturbed them as they walked; from their full hearts\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Welled the soft word, and many a tender name\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strove on their lips as breast to breast they strained\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the deep joy they drank seemed never, never drained.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Love's soul that is the depth of starry skies\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Set in the splendor of one upturned face\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To beam adorably through half-closed eyes;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Love's body where the breadth of summer days\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And all the beauty earth and air comprise\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Come to the compass of an arm's embrace,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To burn a moment on impassioned lips\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yield intemperate joy to quivering finger-tips,\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They knew; and here where morning-glories cling\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Round carven forms of carefullest artifice,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They made a bower where every outward thing\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Should comment on the cause of their own bliss;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With flowers of liveliest hue encompassing\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That flower that the beloved body is - \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That rose that for the banquet of Love's bee\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Has budded all the aeons of past eternity.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But their choice seat was where the garden wall,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Crowning a little summit, far and near,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looks over tufted treetops onto all\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pleasant outer country; rising here\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From rustling foliage where cuckoos call\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On summer evenings, stands a belvedere,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buff-hued, of antique plaster, overrun\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With flowering vines and weatherworn by rain and sun.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still round the turrets of this antique tower\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bougainvillea hangs a crimson crown,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wistaria-vines and clematis in flower,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wreathing the lower surface further down,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hide the old plaster in a very shower\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of motley blossoms like a broidered gown.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside, ascending from the garden grove,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A crumbling stairway winds to the one room above.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And whoso mounts by this dismantled stair\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finds the old pleasure-hall, long disarrayed,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Brick-tiled and raftered, and the walls foursquare\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ringed all about with a twofold arcade.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Backward dense branches intercept the glare\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of afternoon with eucalyptus shade;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eastward the level valley-plains expand,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sweet as a queen's survey of her own Fairyland.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For through that frame the ivied arches make,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wide tracts of sunny midland charm the eye,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frequent with hamlet, grove, and lucent lake\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the blue hills' inverted contours lie;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Far to the east where billowy mountains break\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In surf of snow against a sapphire sky,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Huge thunderheads loom up behind the ranges,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Changing from gold to pink as deepening sunset changes;\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And over plain and far sierra spread\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fulgent rays of fading afternoon,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Showing each utmost peak and watershed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All clarified, each tassel and festoon\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of floating cloud embroidered overhead,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like lotus-leaves on bluest waters strewn,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flushing with rose, while all breathes fresh and free\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In peace and amplitude and bland tranquillity.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dear were such evenings to this gentle pair;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Love's tide that launched on with a blast too strong\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sweeps toward the foaming reef, the hidden snare,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Baffling with fond illusion's siren-song,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Too faint, on idle shoals, to linger there\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Far from Youth's glowing dream, bore them along,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With purple sail and steered by seraph hands\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To isles resplendent in the sunset of romance.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And out of this old house a flowery fane,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A bridal bower, a pearly pleasure-dome,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They built, and furnished it with gold and grain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And bade all spirits of beauty hither come,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And winged Love to enter with his train\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And bless their pillow, and in this his home\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make them his priests as Hero was of yore\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In her sweet girlhood by the blue Dardanian shore.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tree-ferns, therefore, and potted palms they brought,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tripods and urns in rare and curious taste,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Polychrome chests and cabinets inwrought\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With pearl and ivory etched and interlaced;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pendant brocades with massive braid were caught,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And chain-slung, oriental lamps so placed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To light the lounger on some low divan,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sunken in swelling down and silks from Hindustan.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And there was spread, upon the ample floors,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Work of the Levantine's laborious loom,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such as by Euxine or Ionian shores\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Carpets the dim seraglio's scented gloom.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each morn renewed, the garden's flowery stores\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blushed in fair vases, ochre and peach-bloom,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And little birds through wicker doors left wide\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flew in to trill a space from the green world outside.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And there was many a dainty

This will not seem surprising, when we reflect, that the eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the same subject. One may judge that Virgil did not copy it line by line, but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry, and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece. I have endeavoured the same in this imitation of him, though without admitting anything of my own; since it was written with this particular view, that the reader, by comparing the several thoughts, might see how far the images and descriptions of the prophet are superior to those of the poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced them by my management, I shall subjoin the passages of Isaiah and those of Virgil, under the same disadvantage of a literal translation.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ye Nymphs of Solyma!

cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2019Twas a common sordid marriage, and there\u2019s little new to tell,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Save the pub to him was Heaven and his own home was a

her.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friends and relatives assisted, telling her (with motives pure)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That a legal separation was the only earthly cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So she went and saw a lawyer, who, in accents soft and low,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asked her firstly if her husband had a bank account or no;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he hadn\u2019t and she hadn\u2019t, they in fact were very poor,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he bowed her out suggesting she should try some liquor cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She saw a drink cure advertised in the Sydney Bulletin,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cure for brandy, cure for whisky, cure for rum and beer and gin,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it could be given secret, it was tasteless, swift and sure,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So she purchased half a gallon of that Secret Whisky Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she put some in his coffee, smiling sweetly all the while,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he started for the office rather puzzled by the smile,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smile or frown he\u2019d have a whisky, and you\u2019ll say he was a boor,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But perhaps his wife had given him an overdose of Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he met a friend he hadn\u2019t seen for seven years or more,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was just upon the threshold of a private bar-room door,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And they coalised and entered straight away, you may be sure,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But of course they hadn\u2019t reckoned with a Secret Whisky Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jones, he drank, turned pale, and, gasping, hurried out the back way quick,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where, to his old chum\u2019s amazement, he was violently sick;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then they interviewed the landlord, but he swore the drink was pure,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was only the beginning of the Secret Whisky Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Jones couldn\u2019t stand the smell of even special whisky blends,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And shunned bar-rooms to the sorrow of his trusty drinking friends:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And they wondered, too, what evil genius had chanced to lure\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Him from paths of booze and friendship, never dreaming of a Cure.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had noticed, too, with terror that a something turned his feet,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a pub was near, and swung him to the other side the street,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till he thought the devils had him, and his person they\u2019d immure\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a lunatic asylum where there wasn\u2019t any Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He consulted several doctors who were puzzled by the case,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As they mostly are, but never tell the patient to his face,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some advised him \u2018Try the Mountains for this malady obscure:\u2019\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there wasn\u2019t one could diagnose a Secret Whisky

However, you have escaped danger twice, and you have reason to congratulate yourself. I have been sitting here upon ten eggs for three weeks past, and of course have another week to be confined; but then the thoughts of the pleasure I shall have in hatching and guiding my young ones to the water, is ample payment for all my pains. They will look so clean and so delighted, and will do as they are bid by the smallest quack that I can utter, that I must be a bad mother indeed if I am not proud of them. Perhaps you will wonder when I tell you that we have a creature here - fledged indeed - which is called a hen; a strange, cackling, flying, useless, noisy, silly creature, which is as much afraid of water as you are of your decoy. I have often known one of these birds to hatch nine or ten of my eggs; and then, if you wanted to ridicule the lifted foot of conceit, and the dignity of assumed importance, you should see her lead her young, or more properly, see the young lead her to the nearest water they can find. In they go, and she begins to call and scold, and run round the edge to save them from drowning! Now, what fools these hens must be compared to us ducks! at least, I, for one, am determined to think so. I have seen this same hen with the brood about her scratching in our farmyard with all her might; when, not considering who was behind her, or who under her feathers, she has tricked away one little yellow duck with one of her claws, and another with the other, till I wished I had her in a pond; I would have given her a good sousing, depend upon it. But really, cousin, don't you think that this way of contradicting our natures and propensities is very wrong? Suppose, for instance, I should sit upon a dozen of that silly creature's eggs which I mentioned above - for I will never consent to have them matched with us - I should then, to be sure, have a week's holiday, as they sit but three weeks; but what should I bring to light? a parcel of little, useless, tip-toed, cowardly things, that would not follow me into the pond - I cannot bear to think of it. I have written you a long letter, and can think of no more but Quack! quack! quack! and farewell.\n\n"},

said,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Flowers gathered from a crumbling wall,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dead leaves that rustle as they fall;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let me present you in their stead\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something of our New England earth,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A tale which, though of no great worth,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Has still this merit, that it yields\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certain freshness of the fields,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sweetness as of home-made bread.\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Student answered: \"Be discreet;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For if the flour be fresh and sound,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if the bread be light and sweet,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who careth in what mill 't was ground,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or of what oven felt the heat,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unless, as old Cervantes said,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You are looking after better bread\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Than any that is made of wheat?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You know that people nowadays\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To what is old give little praise;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All must be new in prose and verse:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They want hot bread, or something worse,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fresh every morning, and half baked;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wholesome bread of yesterday,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Too stale for them, is thrown away,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is their thirst with water slaked.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As oft we see the sky in May\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Threaten to rain, and yet not rain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Poet's face, before so gay,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was clouded with a look of pain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But suddenly brightened up again;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And without further let or stay\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He told his tale of yesterday."},
