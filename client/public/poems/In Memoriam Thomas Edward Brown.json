October 30, 1897)\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked half-parson and half-skipper: a quaint,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beautiful blend, with blue eyes good to see,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And old-world whiskers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You found him cynic, saint,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Salt, humourist, Christian, poet; with a free,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Far-glancing, luminous utterance; and a heart\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Large as ST. FRANCIS'S: withal a brain\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stored with experience, letters, fancy, art,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And scored with runes of human joy and pain.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till six-and-sixty years he used his gift,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His gift unparalleled, of laughter and tears,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And left the world a high-piled, golden drift\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of verse: to grow more golden with the years,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till the Great Silence fallen upon his ways\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Break into song, and he that had Love have Praise."}
