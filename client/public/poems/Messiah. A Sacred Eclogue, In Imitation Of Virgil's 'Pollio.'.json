{"author": "Alexander Pope", "title": "Messiah. A Sacred Eclogue, In Imitation Of Virgil's 'Pollio.'", "content": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reading several passages of the Prophet Isaiah, which foretell the coming of Christ and the felicities attending it, I could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts, and those in the 'Pollio' of Virgil. This will not seem surprising, when we reflect, that the eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the same subject. One may judge that Virgil did not copy it line by line, but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry, and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece. I have endeavoured the same in this imitation of him, though without admitting anything of my own; since it was written with this particular view, that the reader, by comparing the several thoughts, might see how far the images and descriptions of the prophet are superior to those of the poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced them by my management, I shall subjoin the passages of Isaiah and those of Virgil, under the same disadvantage of a literal translation.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ye Nymphs of Solyma!
