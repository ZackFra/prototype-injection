that, the soul.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We watch her passing, like some gentle dream,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And catch sweet glimpses of her perfect face;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We see the flashing of her gorgeous robes,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, if her mantle ever falls at all,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How few Elishas wear it sacredly,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As if it were a valued gift from heaven.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0God has created; we but re-create,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the temper of our minds;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the grace He has bequeathed;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the uses we have made\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of His good-pleasure given unto us.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I love my art; chiefly, because\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through it I rev'rence Nature, and improve\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tone and tenor of the mind He gave.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0God sends a Gift; we crown it with high Art,\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And make it worthy the bestower, when\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The talent is not hidden in the dust\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of pampered negligence and venial sin,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But put to studious use, that it may work\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The end and aim for which it was bestowed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All Good is God's; all Love and Truth are His;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are His workers; and we dare not plead\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that He gave us largely of all these,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Demanding a discreet return, that when\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The page of life is written to its close\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may receive the seal and autograph\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of His good pleasure - the right royal sign\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And signet of approval, to the end\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That we were worthy of the gift divine,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And through it praised the Great Artificer.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my long rambles through Orillian woods;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Out on the ever-changing Couchiching;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the rough margin of the Lake St. John;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Down the steep Severn, where the artist sun,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In dainty dalliance with the blushing stream,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transcribes each tree, branch, leaf, and rock and flower,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perfect in shape and colour, clear, distinct,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With all the panoramic change of sky - \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even as Youth's bright river, toying with\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fairy craft where Inexperience dreams,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And subtle Fancy builds its airy halls,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In blest imagination pictures most\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of bright or lovely that adorn life's banks,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the blue vault of heaven over all;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On that serene and wizard afternoon,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As hunters chase the wild and timid deer\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We chased the quiet of Medonte's shades\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through the green windings of the forest road,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Past Nature's venerable rank and file\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of primal woods - her Old Guard, sylvan-plumed - \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The far-off Huron, like a silver thread,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The clue to some enchanted labyrinth,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dimly perceived beyond the stretch of woods,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Th' approaches tinted by a purple haze,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And softened into beauty like the dream\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of some rapt seer's Apocalyptic mood;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when at Rockridge we sat looking out\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon the softened shadows of the night,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the wild glory of the throbbing stars;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where'er we bent our Eden-tinted way:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My brain was a weird wilderness of Thought:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My heart, love's sea of passion tossed and torn,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calmed by the presence of the loving souls\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By whom I was surrounded.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the while\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They deemed me passing tame, and wondered when\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My dreamy castle would come toppling down.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was but driving back the aching past,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And mirroring the future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And these leaves\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of meditation are but perfumes from\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The censer of my feelings;
