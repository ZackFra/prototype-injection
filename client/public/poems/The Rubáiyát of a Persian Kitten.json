another Guest.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They say the Lion and the Lizard keep\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Courts where Jamsh\u00fdd gloried and drank deep.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The

empty Tum.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One thing is certain: tho' this Stolen Bite\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should be my last and Wrath consume me quite,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One taste of It within the Area caught\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better than at the Table lost outright.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, indeed Repentance oft before\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I swore, but was I hungry when I swore?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then and then came Cook--with Hose in hand--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And drowned my glory in a sorry pour.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What without asking hither harried whence,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And without asking whither harried hence--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O, many a taste of that forbidden Sole\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must down the memory of that Insolence.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heaven, but the vision of a Flowing Bowl;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Hell, the sizzle of a Frying Sole\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heard in the hungry Darkness, where Myself,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So rudely cast, must impotently roll.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Vine has a tough Fibre which about\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While clings my Being;--let the Canine Flout\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till his Bass Voice be pitched to such loud key\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It shall unlock the door I mew without.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Up from the Basement to the Seventh Flat\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I rose, and on the Crown of Fashion sat,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And many a Ball unravelled by the way--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But not the Master's angry Bawl of \"Scat!\"\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then to the Well of Wisdom I--and lo!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With my own Paw I wrought to make it flow,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And This was all the Harvest that I reaped:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We come like Kittens and like Cats we go.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why be this Ink the Fount of Wit?--who dare\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Blaspheme the glistening Pen-drink as a snare?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Blessing?--I should spread it, should I not?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if a Curse--why, then upset it!--there!\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A moment's Halt, a momentary Taste\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of Bitter, and amid the Trickling Waste\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I wrought strange shapes from M\u00e1h to M\u00e1hi, yet\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I know not what I wrote, nor why they chased.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now I beyond the Pale am safely past.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O, but the long, long time their Rage shall last,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which, tho' they call to supper, I shall heed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a Stone Cat should heed a Pebble cast.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And that perverted Soul beneath the Sky\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They call the Dog--Heed not his angry Cry;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not all his Threats can make me budge one bit,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor all his Empty Bluster terrify.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They are no other than a moving Show\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of whirling Shadow Shapes that come and go\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Me-ward thro' Moon illumined Darkness hurled,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In midnight, by the Lodgers in the Row.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Myself when young did eagerly frequent\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Backyard Fence and heard great Argument\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About it, and About, yet evermore\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Came out with Fewer Fur than in I went.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ah, me! if you and I could but conspire\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To grasp this Sorry Scheme of things entire,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Would we not shatter it to bits, and then\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enfold it nearer to our Heart's Desire?\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tho' Two and Two make Four by rule of line,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or they make Twenty-two by Logic fine,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of all the Figures one may fathom, I\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shall ne'er be floored by anything but Nine.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And fear not lest Existence shut the Door\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On You and Me, to open it no more.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cream of Life from out your Bowl shall pour\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nine times--ere it lie broken on the Floor.\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, if the Fish you Steal--the Cream you drink--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ends in what all begins and ends in, Think,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unless the Stern Recorder points to Nine,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tho' They would drown you--still you shall not sink.\n"}
