{"author": "Mark Akenside", "title": "To Sir Francis Henry Drake, Baronet", "content": "Behold; the Balance in the sky\r\nSwift on the wintry scale inclines:\r\nTo earthy caves the Dryads fly,\r\nAnd the bare pastures Pan resigns.\r\nLate did the farmer's fork o'erspread\r\nWith recent soil the twice-mown mead,\r\nTainting the bloom which autumn knows:\r\nHe whets the rusty coulter now,\r\nHe binds his oxen to the plough,\r\nAnd wide his future harvest throws.\r\nNow, London's busy confines round,\r\nBy Kensington's imperial towers,\r\nFrom Highgate's rough descent profound,\r\nEssexian heaths, or Kentish bowers,\r\nWhere'er I pass, I see approach\r\nSome rural statesman's eager coach\r\nHurried by senatorial cares:\r\nWhile rural nymphs (alike, within,\r\nAspiring courtly praise to win)\r\nDebate their dress, reform their airs.\r\nSay, what can now the country boast,\r\nO Drake, thy footsteps to detain,\r\nWhen peevish winds and gloomy frost\r\nThe sunshine of the temper stain?\r\nSay, are the priests of Devon grown\r\nFriends to this tolerating throne,\r\nChampions for George's legal right?\r\nHave general freedom, equal law,\r\nWon to the glory of Nassau\r\nEach bold Wessexian squire and knight?\r\nI doubt it much; and guess at least\r\nThat when the day, which made us free,\r\nShall next return, that sacred feast\r\nThou better may'st observe with me.\r\nWith me the sulphurous treason old\r\nA far inferior part shall hold\r\nIn that glad day's triumphal strain;\r\nAnd generous William be rever'd,\r\nNor one untimely accent heard\r\nOf James or his ignoble reign.\n\r\nThen, while the Gascon's fragrant wine\r\nWith modest cups our joy supplies,\r\nWe'll truly thank the power divine\r\nWho bade the chief, the patriot rise;\r\nRise from heroic ease (the spoil\r\nDue, for his youth's Herculean toil,\r\nFrom Belgium to her savior son)\r\nRise with the same unconquer'd zeal\r\nFor our Britannia's injur'd weal,\r\nHer laws defac'd, her shrines o'erthrown.\r\nHe came. The tyrant from our shore,\r\nLike a forbidden demon, fled;\r\nAnd to eternal exile bore\r\nPontific rage and vassal dread.\r\nThere sunk the mouldering Gothic reign:\r\nNew years came forth, a liberal train,\r\nCall'd by the people's great decree.\r\nThat day, my friend, let blessings crown:\r\nFill, to the demigod's renown\r\nFrom whom thou hast that thou art free.\r\nThen, Drake, (for wherefore should we part\r\nThe public and the private weal?)\r\nIn vows to her who sways thy heart,\r\nFair health, glad fortune, will we deal.\n\r\nWhether Aglaia's blooming cheek,\r\nOr the soft ornaments that speak\r\nSo eloquent in Daphne's smile,\r\nWhether the piercing lights that fly\r\nFrom the dark heaven of Myrto's eye,\r\nHaply thy fancy then beguile.\r\nFor so it is. thy stubborn breast,\r\nThough touch'd by many a slighter wound,\r\nHath no full conquest yet confess'd,\r\nNor the one fatal charmer found.\r\nWhile I, a true and loyal swain,\r\nMy fair Olympia's gentle reign\r\nThrough all the varying seasons own.\r\nHer genius still my bosom warms:\r\nNo other maid for me hath charms,\r\nOr I have eyes for her alone."}
