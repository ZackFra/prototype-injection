{"author": "William Butler Yeats", "title": "Three Marching Songs", "content": "Remember all those renowned generations,\r\nThey left their bodies to fatten the wolves,\r\nThey left their homesteads to fatten the foxes,\r\nFled to far countries, or sheltered themselves\r\nIn cavern, crevice, or hole,\r\nDefending Ireland's soul.\r\ni(Be still, be still, what can be said?\r\nMy father sang that song,\r\nBut time amends old wrong,\r\nAll that is finished, let it fade.)\r\nRemember all those renowned generations,\r\nRemember all that have sunk in their blood,\r\nRemember all that have died on the scaffold,\r\nRemember all that have fled, that have stood,\r\nStood, took death like a tune\r\nOn an old,tambourine.\r\ni(Be still, be still, what can be said?\r\nMy father sang that song,\r\nBut time amends old wrong,\r\nAnd all that's finished, let it fade.)\r\nFail, and that history turns into rubbish,\r\nAll that great past to a trouble of fools;\r\nThose that come after shall mock at O'Donnell,\r\nMock at the memory of both O'Neills,\r\nMock Emmet, mock Parnell,\r\nAll the renown that fell.\r\ni(Be still, be still, what can be said?\r\nMy father sang that song,\r\nbut time amends old wrong,\r\nAnd all that's finished, let it fade.)\r\nThe soldier takes pride in saluting his Captain,\r\nThe devotee proffers a knee to his Lord,\r\nSome back a mare thrown from a thoroughbred,,\r\nTroy backed its Helen; Troy died and adored;\r\nGreat nations blossom above;\r\nA slave bows down to a slave.\r\ni(What marches through the mountain pass?\r\nNo, no, my son, not yet;\r\nThat is an airy spot,\r\nAnd no man knows what treads the grass.)\r\nWe know what rascal might has defiled,\r\nThe lofty innocence that it has slain,\r\nWere we not born in the peasant's cot\r\nWhere men forgive if the belly gain?\r\nMore dread the life that we live,\r\nHow can the mind forgive?\r\ni(What marches down the mountain pass?\r\nNo, no, my son, not yet;\r\nThat is an airy spot,\r\nAnd no man knows what treads the grass.)\r\nWhat if there's nothing up there at the top?\r\nWhere are the captains that govern mankind?\r\nWhat tears down a tree that has nothing within it?\r\nA blast of the wind, O a marching wind,\r\nMarch wind, and any old tune.\r\nMarch, march, and how does it run?\r\ni(What marches down the mountain pass?\r\nNo, no, my son, not yet;)\r\ni(That is an airy spot,\r\nAnd no man knows what treads the grass.)\n\r\nIII\n\r\nGrandfather sang it under the gallows:\r\n\"Hear, gentlemen, ladies, and all mankind:\r\nMoney is good and a girl might be better,\r\nBut good strong blows are delights to the mind.'\r\nThere, standing on the cart,\r\nHe sang it from his heart.\n\r\nAnd rattled out a tune;\r\nRobbers had taken his old tambourine.\r\n\"A girl I had, but she followed another,\r\nMoney I had, and it went in the night,\r\nStrong drink I had, and it brought me to sorrow,\r\nBut a good strong cause and blows are delight.\"\r\nAll there caught up the tune:\r\n\"Oh, on, my darling man.\"\n\r\nAnd rattled out a tune;\r\ni(Robbers had taken his old tambourine.)\r\n\"Money is good and a girl might be better,\r\nNo matter what happens and who takes the fall,\r\nBut a good strong cause\" -- the rope gave a jerk there,\r\nNo more sang he, for his throat was too small;\r\nBut he kicked before he died,\r\nHe did it out of pride.\n\r\nAnd rattled out a tune;\r\nRobbers had taken his old tambourine."}
