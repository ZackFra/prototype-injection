plain\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With tinted walls a space on either hand\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And fed by many an olive-darkened lane\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The high-road mounts, and thence a silver band\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through vineyard slopes above and rolling grain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Winds off to that dim corner of the skies\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where behind sunset hills a stately city lies.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, among trees whose overhanging shade\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strews petals on the little droves below,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pattering townward in the morning weighed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With greens from many an upland garden-row,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Runs an old wall; long centuries have frayed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Its scalloped edge, and passers to and fro\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heard never from beyond its crumbling height\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sweet laughter ring at noon or plaintive song at night.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But here where little lizards bask and blink\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tendrils of the trumpet-vine have run,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At whose red bells the humming bird to drink\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stops oft before his garden feast is done;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And rose-geraniums, with that tender pink\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That cloud-banks borrow from the setting sun,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Have covered part of this old wall, entwined\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With fair plumbago, blue as evening heavens behind.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And crowning other parts the wild white rose\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rivals the honey-suckle with the bees.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Above the old abandoned orchard shows\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And all within beneath the dense-set trees,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tall and luxuriant the rank grass grows,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That settled in its wavy depth one sees\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grass melt in leaves, the mossy trunks between,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Down fading avenues of implicated green;\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wherein no lack of flowers the verdurous night\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With stars and pearly nebula o'erlay;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Azalea-boughs half rosy and half white\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shine through the green and clustering apple-spray,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such as the fairy-queen before her knight\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Waved in old story, luring him away\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where round lost isles Hesperian billows break\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or towers loom up beneath the clear, translucent lake;\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And under the deep grass blue hare-bells hide,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And myrtle plots with dew-fall ever wet,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gay tiger-lilies flammulate and pied,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometime on pathway borders neatly set,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now blossom through the brake on either side,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where heliotrope and weedy mignonette,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With vines in bloom and flower-bearing trees,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mingle their incense all to swell the perfumed breeze,\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That sprung like Hermes from his natal cave\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In some blue rampart of the curving West,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comes up the valleys where green cornfields wave,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ravels the cloud about the mountain crest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breathes on the lake till gentle ripples pave\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Its placid floor; at length a long-loved guest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He steals across this plot of pleasant ground,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Waking the vocal leaves to a sweet vernal sound.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here many a day right gladly have I sped,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Content amid the wavy plumes to lie,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And through the woven branches overhead\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Watch the white, ever-wandering clouds go by,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And soaring birds make their dissolving bed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Far in the azure depths of summer sky,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or nearer that small huntsman of the air,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fly-catcher, dart nimbly from his leafy lair;\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pillowed at ease to hear the merry tune\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of mating warblers in the boughs above\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And shrill cicadas whom the hottest noon\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keeps not from drowsy song; the mourning dove\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pours down the murmuring grove his plaintive croon\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That like the voice of visionary love\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oft have I risen to seek through this green maze\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Even as my feet thread now the great world's garden-ways);\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, parting tangled bushes as I passed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Down beechen alleys beautiful and dim,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps by some deep-shaded pool at last\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My feet would pause, where goldfish poise and swim,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And snowy callas' velvet cups are massed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Around the mossy, fern-encircled brim.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, then, that magic summoning would cease,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or sound far off again among the orchard trees.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And here where the blanched lilies of the vale\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And violets and yellow star-flowers teem,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And pink and purple hyacinths exhale\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Their heavy fume, once more to drowse and dream\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My head would sink, from many an olden tale\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Drawing imagination's fervid theme,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or haply peopling this enchanting spot\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only with fair creations of fantastic thought.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For oft I think, in years long since gone by,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That gentle hearts dwelt here and gentle hands\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stored all this bowery bliss to beautify\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The paradise of some unsung romance;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, safe from all except the loved one's eye,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'Tis sweet to think white limbs were wont to glance,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well pleased to wanton like the flowers and share\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Their simple loveliness with the enamored air.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thrice dear to them whose votive fingers decked\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The altars of First Love were these green ways, - \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These lawns and verdurous brakes forever flecked\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the warm sunshine of midsummer days;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oft where the long straight allies intersect\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And marble seats surround the open space,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where a tiled pool and sculptured fountain stand,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hath Evening found them seated, silent, hand in hand.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When twilight deepened, in the gathering shade\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Beneath that old titanic cypress row,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whose sombre vault and towering colonnade\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dwarfed the enfolded forms that moved below,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oft with close steps these happy lovers strayed,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Till down its darkening aisle the sunset glow\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grew less and patterning the garden floor\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Faint flakes of filtering moonlight mantled more and more.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the strange tempest that a touch imparts\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through the mid fibre of the molten frame,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the sweet flesh in early youth asserts\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Its heyday verve and little hints enflame,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Disturbed them as they walked; from their full hearts\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Welled the soft word, and many a tender name\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strove on their lips as breast to breast they strained\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the deep joy they drank seemed never, never drained.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Love's soul that is the depth of starry skies\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Set in the splendor of one upturned face\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To beam adorably through half-closed eyes;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Love's body where the breadth of summer days\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And all the beauty earth and air comprise\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Come to the compass of an arm's embrace,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To burn a moment on impassioned lips\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yield intemperate joy to quivering finger-tips,\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They knew; and here where morning-glories cling\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Round carven forms of carefullest artifice,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They made a bower where every outward thing\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Should comment on the cause of their own bliss;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With flowers of liveliest hue encompassing\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That flower that the beloved body is - \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That rose that for the banquet of Love's bee\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Has budded all the aeons of past eternity.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But their choice seat was where the garden wall,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Crowning a little summit, far and near,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looks over tufted treetops onto all\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pleasant outer country; rising here\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From rustling foliage where cuckoos call\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On summer evenings, stands a belvedere,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buff-hued, of antique plaster, overrun\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With flowering vines and weatherworn by rain and sun.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still round the turrets of this antique tower\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bougainvillea hangs a crimson crown,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wistaria-vines and clematis in flower,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wreathing the lower surface further down,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hide the old plaster in a very shower\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of motley blossoms like a broidered gown.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside, ascending from the garden grove,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A crumbling stairway winds to the one room above.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And whoso mounts by this dismantled stair\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finds the old pleasure-hall, long disarrayed,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Brick-tiled and raftered, and the walls foursquare\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ringed all about with a twofold arcade.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Backward dense branches intercept the glare\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of afternoon with eucalyptus shade;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eastward the level valley-plains expand,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sweet as a queen's survey of her own Fairyland.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For through that frame the ivied arches make,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wide tracts of sunny midland charm the eye,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frequent with hamlet, grove, and lucent lake\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where the blue hills' inverted contours lie;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Far to the east where billowy mountains break\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In surf of snow against a sapphire sky,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Huge thunderheads loom up behind the ranges,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Changing from gold to pink as deepening sunset changes;\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And over plain and far sierra spread\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fulgent rays of fading afternoon,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Showing each utmost peak and watershed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All clarified, each tassel and festoon\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of floating cloud embroidered overhead,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like lotus-leaves on bluest waters strewn,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flushing with rose, while all breathes fresh and free\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In peace and amplitude and bland tranquillity.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dear were such evenings to this gentle pair;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Love's tide that launched on with a blast too strong\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sweeps toward the foaming reef, the hidden snare,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Baffling with fond illusion's siren-song,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Too faint, on idle shoals, to linger there\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Far from Youth's glowing dream, bore them along,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With purple sail and steered by seraph hands\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To isles resplendent in the sunset of romance.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And out of this old house a flowery fane,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A bridal bower, a pearly pleasure-dome,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They built, and furnished it with gold and grain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And bade all spirits of beauty hither come,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And winged Love to enter with his train\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And bless their pillow, and in this his home\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make them his priests as Hero was of yore\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In her sweet girlhood by the blue Dardanian shore.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tree-ferns, therefore, and potted palms they brought,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tripods and urns in rare and curious taste,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Polychrome chests and cabinets inwrought\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With pearl and ivory etched and interlaced;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pendant brocades with massive braid were caught,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And chain-slung, oriental lamps so placed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To light the lounger on some low divan,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sunken in swelling down and silks from Hindustan.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And there was spread, upon the ample floors,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Work of the Levantine's laborious loom,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such as by Euxine or Ionian shores\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Carpets the dim seraglio's scented gloom.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each morn renewed, the garden's flowery stores\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blushed in fair vases, ochre and peach-bloom,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And little birds
