Romance! How I've dreamed it, writing\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dreary old records of money and mart,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Me with my head chuckful of fighting\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And the blood of vikings to thrill my heart.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But little I thought that my time was coming,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sudden and splendid, supreme and soon;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And here I am with the bullets humming\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As I crawl and I curse the light of the moon.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Out alone, for adventure thirsting,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Out in mysterious No Man's Land;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prone with the dead when a star-shell, bursting,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Flares on the horrors on every hand.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are ruby stars and they drip and wiggle;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And the grasses gleam in a light blood-red;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are emerald stars, and their tails they wriggle,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And ghastly they glare on the face of the dead.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But the worst of all are the stars of whiteness,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That spill in a pool of pearly flame,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pretty as gems in their silver brightness,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And etching a man for a bullet's aim.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yet oh, it's great to be here with danger,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Here in the weird, death-pregnant dark,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the devil's pasture a stealthy ranger,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the moon is decently hiding. Hark!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What was that? Was it just the shiver\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of an eerie wind or a clammy hand?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rustle of grass, or the passing quiver\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of one of the ghosts of No Man's Land?\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It's only at night when the ghosts awaken,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And gibber and whisper horrible things;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For to every foot of this God-forsaken\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zone of jeopard some horror clings.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ugh! What was that? It felt like a jelly,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That flattish mound in the noisome grass;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You three big rats running free of its belly,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Out of my way and let me pass!\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But if there's horror, there's beauty, wonder;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The trench lights gleam and the rockets play.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That flood of magnificent orange yonder\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is a battery blazing miles away.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a rush and a singing a great shell passes;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rifles resentfully bicker and brawl,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And here I crouch in the dew-drenched grasses,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And look and listen and love it all.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 God! What a life! But I must make haste now,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before the shadow of night be spent.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It's little the time there is to waste now,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I'd do the job for which I was sent.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My bombs are right and my clippers ready,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I wriggle out to the chosen place,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I hear a rustle . . . Steady! . . . Steady!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who am I staring slap in the face?\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There in the dark I can hear him breathing,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A foot away, and as still as death;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And my heart beats hard, and my brain is seething,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I know he's a Hun by the smell of his breath.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then: \"Will you surrender?\" I whisper hoarsely,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For it's death, swift death to utter a cry.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"English schwein-hund!\" he murmurs coarsely.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Then we'll fight it out in the dark,\" say I.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So we grip and we slip and we trip and wrestle\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There in the gutter of No Man's Land;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I feel my nails in his wind-pipe nestle,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And he tries to gouge, but I bite his hand.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And he tries to squeal, but I squeeze him tighter:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Now,\" I say, \"I can kill you fine;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But tell me first, you Teutonic blighter!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you any children?\" He answers: \"Nein.\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NINE! Well, I cannot kill such a father,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I tie his hands and I leave him there.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do I finish my little job? Well, rather;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I get home safe with some light to spare.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heigh-ho! by day it's just prosy duty,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Doing the same old song and dance;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But oh! with the night - joy, glory, beauty:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Over the parapet - Life, Romance!"}
