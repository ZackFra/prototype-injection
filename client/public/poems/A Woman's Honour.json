{"author": "John Wilmot", "title": "A Woman's Honour", "content": "Love bade me hope, and I obeyed;\r\nPhyllis continued still unkind:\r\nThen you may e'en despair, he said,\r\nIn vain I strive to change her mind.\n\r\nHonour's got in, and keeps her heart,\r\nDurst he but venture once abroad,\r\nIn my own right I'd take your part,\r\nAnd show myself the mightier God.\n\r\nThis huffing Honour domineers\r\nIn breasts alone where he has place:\r\nBut if true generous Love appears,\r\nThe hector dares not show his face.\n\r\nLet me still languish and complain,\r\nBe most unhumanly denied:\r\nI have some pleasure in my pain,\r\nShe can have none with all her pride.\n\r\nI fall a sacrifice to Love,\r\nShe lives a wretch for Honour's sake;\r\nWhose tyrant does most cruel prove,\r\nThe difference is not hard to make.\n\r\nConsider real Honour then,\r\nYou'll find hers cannot be the same;\r\n'Tis noble confidence in men,\r\nIn women, mean, mistrustful shame.
