{"author": "Robert Lee Frost", "title": "Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening", "content": "Whose woods these are I think I know.\r\nHis house is in the village, though;\r\nHe will not see me stopping here\r\nTo watch his woods fill up with snow.\n\r\nMy little horse must think it's queer\r\nTo stop without a farmhouse near\r\nBetween the woods and frozen lake\r\nThe darkest evening of the year.\n\r\nHe gives his harness bells a shake\r\nTo ask if there's some mistake.\r\nThe only other sound's the sweep\r\nOf easy wind and downy flake.\n\r\nThe woods are lovely, dark, and deep,\r\nBut I have promises to keep,\r\nAnd miles to go before I sleep,\r\nAnd miles to go before I sleep."}
