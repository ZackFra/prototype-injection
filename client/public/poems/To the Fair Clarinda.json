{"author": "Aphra Behn", "title": "To the Fair Clarinda", "content": "Who made love to me,\r\nImagin'd more than woman.\n\r\nFair lovely Maid, or if that Title be\r\nToo weak, too Feminine for Nobler thee,\r\nPermit a Name that more Approaches Truth:\r\nAnd let me call thee, Lovely Charming Youth.\r\nThis last will justify my soft complaint,\r\nWhile that may serve to lessen my constraint;\r\nAnd without Blushes I the Youth pursue,\r\nWhen so much beauteous Woman is in view.\r\nAgainst thy Charms we struggle but in vain\r\nWith thy deluding Form thou giv'st us pain,\r\nWhile the bright Nymph betrays us to the Swain.\r\nIn pity to our Sex sure thou wer't sent,\r\nThat we might Love, and yet be Innocent:\r\nFor sure no Crime with thee we can commit;\r\nOr if we shou'd - thy Form excuses it.\r\nFor who, that gathers fairest Flowers believes\r\nA Snake lies hid beneath the Fragrant Leaves.\n\r\nThough beauteous Wonder of a different kind,\r\nSoft Cloris with the dear Alexis join'd;\r\nWhen e'er the Manly part of thee, wou'd plead\r\nThough tempts us with the Image of the Maid,\r\nWhile we the noblest Passions do extend\r\nThe Love to Hermes, Aphrodite the Friend."}
