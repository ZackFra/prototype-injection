earth?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the year, when his heart is fulfilled with desire of the days of his mirth,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Redeem them, recall, or remember?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a memory recalling the rapture of earth, and redeeming the sky,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shines down from the heights to the depths: will the watchword of dawn be July\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When to-morrow acclaims November?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The stern salutation of sorrow to death or repentance to shame\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was all that the season was wont to accord her of grace or acclaim;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No lightnings of love and of laughter.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But here, in the laugh of the loud west wind from around and above,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the flash of the waters beneath him, what sound or what light but of love\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rings round him or leaps forth after?\n\r\nII\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wind beloved of earth and sky and sea beyond all winds that blow,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wind whose might in fight was England's on her mightiest warrior day,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0South-west wind, whose breath for her was life, and fire to scourge her foe,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steel to smite and death to drive him down an unreturning way,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well-beloved and welcome, sounding all the clarions of the sky,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rolling all the marshalled waters toward the charge that storms the shore,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We receive, acclaim, salute thee, we who live and dream and die,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the mightiest mouth of song that ever spake acclaimed of yore.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We that live as they that perish praise thee, lord of cloud and wave,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wind of winds, clothed on with darkness whence as lightning light comes forth,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We that know thee strong to guard and smite, to scatter and to save,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We to whom the south-west wind is dear as Athens held the north.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He for her waged war as thou for us against all powers defiant,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fleets full-fraught with storm from Persia, laden deep with death from Spain:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thee the giant god of song and battle hailed as god and giant,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet not his but ours the land is whence thy praise should ring and rain;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rain as rapture shed from song, and ring as trumpets blown for battle,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sound and sing before thee, loud and glad as leaps and sinks the sea:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yea, the sea's white steeds are curbed and spurred of thee, and pent as cattle,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet they laugh with love and pride to live, subdued not save of thee.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ears that hear thee hear in heaven the sound of widening wings gigantic,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eyes that see the cloud-lift westward see thy darkening brows divine;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wings whose measure is the limit of the limitless Atlantic,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Brows that bend, and bid the sovereign sea submit her soul to thine.\n\r\nIII\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twelve days since is it, twelve days gone,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lord of storm, that a storm-bow shone\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Higher than sweeps thy sublime dark wing,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fair as dawn is and sweet like spring?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Never dawn in the deep wide east\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spread so splendid and strange a feast,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whence the soul as it drank and fed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Felt such rapture of wonder shed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Never spring in the wild wood's heart\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Felt such flowers at her footfall start,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Born of earth, as arose on sight\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Born of heaven and of storm and light.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stern and sullen, the grey grim sea\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swelled and strove as in toils, though free,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Free as heaven, and as heaven sublime,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clear as heaven of the toils of time.\n\r\nIV\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, sheer from the heights to the depths of the sky and the sea,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sprang from the darkness alive as a vision of life to be\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Glory triune and transcendent of colour afar and afire,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arching and darkening the darkness with light as of dream or desire.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heaven, in the depth of its height, shone wistful and wan from above:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earth from beneath, and the sea, shone stricken and breathless with love.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a shadow may shine, so shone they; as ghosts of the viewless blest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That sleep hath sight of alive in a rapture of sunbright rest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The green earth glowed and the grey sky gleamed for a wondrous while;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the storm's full frown was crossed by the light of its own deep smile.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the darkness of thought and of passion is touched by the light that gives\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Life deathless as love from the depth of a spirit that sees and lives,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the soul of a seer and a singer, wherein as a scroll unfurled\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lies open the scripture of light and of darkness, the word of the world,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, shapeless and measureless, lurid as anguish and haggard as crime,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pale as the front of oblivion and dark as the heart of time,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wild wan heaven at its height was assailed and subdued and made\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More fair than the skies that know not of storm and endure not shade.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The grim sea-swell, grey, sleepless, and sad as a soul estranged,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shone, smiled, took heart, and was glad of its wrath: and the world's face changed.\n\r\nV\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Up from moorlands northward gleaming\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even to heaven's transcendent height,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clothed with massive cloud, and seeming\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All one fortress reared of night,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Down to where the deep sea, dreaming\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Angry dreams, lay dark and white,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0White as death and dark as fate,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heaving with the strong wind's weight,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sad with stormy pride of state,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One full rainbow shone elate.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Up from inmost memory's dwelling\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the light of life abides,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the past finds tongue, foretelling\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Time that comes and grace that guides,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Power that saves and sways, compelling\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Souls that ebb and flow like tides,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shone or seemed to shine and swim\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through the cloud-surf great and grim,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thought's live surge, the soul of him\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By whose light the sun looks dim.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In what synod were they sitting,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the gods and lords of time,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whence they watched as fen-fires flitting\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Years and names of men sublime,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When their counsels found it fitting\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One should stand where none might climb,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of man begotten, none\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Born of men beneath the sun\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till the race of time be run,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Save this heaven-enfranchised one?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With what rapture of creation\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was the soul supernal thrilled,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With what pride of adoration\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was the world's heart fired and filled,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heaved in heavenward exaltation\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Higher than hopes or dreams might build,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grave with awe not known while he\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was not, mad with glorious glee\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the sun-saluted sea,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When his hour bade Shakespeare be?\n\r\nVI\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There, clear as night beholds her crowning seven,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sea beheld his likeness set in heaven.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The shadow of his spirit full in sight\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shone: for the shadow of that soul is light.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor heaven alone bore witness: earth avowed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Him present, and acclaimed of storm aloud.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the arching sky to the ageless hills and sea\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The whole world, visible, audible, was he:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each part of all that wove that wondrous whole\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The raiment of the presence of his soul.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sun that smote and kissed the dark to death\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spake, smiled, and strove, like song's triumphant breath;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The soundless cloud whose thunderous heart was dumb\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swelled, lowered, and shrank to feel its conqueror come.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet high from heaven its empire vast and vain\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frowned, and renounced not night's reluctant reign.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The serpentine swift sounds and shapes wherein\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The stainless sea mocks earth and death and sin,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crawls dark as craft, or flashes keen as hate,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subdued and insubmissive, strong like fate\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And weak like man, bore wrathful witness yet\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That storms and sins are more than suns that set;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That evil everlasting, girt for strife\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eternal, wars with hope as death with life.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dark sharp shifting wind that bade the waves\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Falter, lose heart, bow down like foes made slaves,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And waxed within more bitter as they bowed,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Baffling the sea, swallowing the sun with cloud,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Devouring fast as fire on earth devours\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And hungering hard as frost that feeds on flowers,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clothed round with fog that reeked as fume from hell,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And darkening with its miscreative spell\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Light, glad and keen and splendid as the sword\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whose heft had known Othello's hand its lord,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spake all the soul that hell drew back to greet\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And felt its fire shrink shuddering from his feet.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Far off the darkness darkened, and recoiled,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And neared again, and triumphed: and the coiled\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colourless cloud and sea discoloured grew\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conscious of horror huge as heaven, and knew\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where Goneril's soul made chill and foul the mist,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And all the leprous life in Regan hissed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fierce homeless ghosts, rejected of the pit,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From hell to hell of storm fear watched them flit.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About them and before, the dull grey gloom\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shuddered, and heaven seemed hateful as the tomb\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That shrinks from resurrection; and from out\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That sullen hell which girt their shades about\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The nether soul that lurks and lowers within\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Man, made of dust and fire and shame and sin,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breathed: all the cloud that felt it breathe and blight\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was blue as plague or black as thunderous night.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elect of hell, the children of his hate\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thronged, as to storm sweet heaven's triumphal gate.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The terror of his giving rose and shone\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Imminent: life had put its likeness on.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But higher than all its horrent height of shade\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shone sovereign, seen by light itself had made,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Above the woes of all the world, above\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Life, sin, and death, his myriad-minded love.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From landward heights whereon the radiance leant\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Full-fraught from heaven, intense and imminent,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To depths wherein the seething strengths of cloud\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarce matched the wrath of waves whereon they bowed,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From homeborn pride and kindling love of home\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the outer skies and seas of fire and foam,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From splendour soft as dew that sundawn thrills\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To gloom that shudders round the world it fills,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From midnights murmuring round Titania's ear\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To midnights maddening round the rage of Lear,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wonder woven of storm and sun became\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One with the light that lightens from his name.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The music moving on the sea that felt\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The storm-wind even as snows of springtide melt\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was blithe as Ariel's hand or voice might make\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And bid all grief die gladly for its sake.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And there the soul alive in ear and eye\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That watched the wonders of an hour pass by\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saw brighter than all stars that heaven inspheres\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The silent splendour of Cordelia's tears,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Felt in the whispers of the quickening wind\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The radiance of the laugh of Rosalind,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And heard, in sounds that melt the souls of men\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With love of love, the tune of Imogen.\n\r\nVII\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the strong north-east is not strong to subdue and to slay the divine south-west,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the darkness is less than the light that it darkens, and dies in reluctant rest.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It hovers and hangs on the labouring and trembling ascent of the dawn from the deep,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till the sun's eye quicken the world and the waters, and smite it again into sleep.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Night, holy and starry, the fostress of souls, with the fragrance of heaven in her breath,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subdues with the sense of her godhead the forces and mysteries of sorrow and death.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eternal as dawn's is the comfort she gives: but the mist that beleaguers and slays\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comes, passes, and is not: the strength of it withers, appalled or assuaged by the day's.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Faith, haggard as Fear that had borne her, and dark as the sire that begat her, Despair,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Held rule on the soul of the world and the song of it saddening through ages that were;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dim centuries that darkened and brightened and darkened again, and the soul of their song\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was great as their grief, and sublime as their suffering, and strong as their sorrows were strong.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It knew not, it saw not, but shadows triune, and evoked by the strength of their spell\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dark hell, and the mountain of anguish, and heaven that was hollower and harder than hell.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These are not: the womb of the darkness that bare them rejects them, and knows them no more:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thought, fettered in misery and iron, revives in the light that it lived in of yore.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the soul that is wisdom and freedom, the spirit of England redeemed from her past,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speaks life through the lips of the master and lord of her children, the first and the last.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thought, touched by his hand and redeemed by his breath, sees, hears, and accepts from above\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limitless lightnings of vision and passion, the measureless music of love."}
