Isabel,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dark-eyed, spiritual Isabel\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was leaning on her harp, and I had stay\u2019d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To whisper what I could not when the crowd\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hung on her look like worshippers. I knelt,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with the fervor of a lip unused\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the cool breath of reason, told my love.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was no answer, and I took the hand\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That rested on the strings, and press\u2019d a kiss\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon it unforbidden, and again\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besought her, that this silent evidence\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That I was not indifferent to her heart,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Might have the seal of one sweet syllable.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I kiss\u2019d the small white fingers as I spoke,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she withdrew them gently, and upraised\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her forehead from its resting place, and look\u2019d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earnestly on me, She had been asleep"}
