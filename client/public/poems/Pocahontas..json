played they with the yellow corn;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And in Winter oft on snowshoes circled round.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Maidens,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0come,

of Indians by explorers,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By those traders who had lust for slaves and gold.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Years had passed since first the Red Man heard the

said,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It were wiser name yon city-in-the-wilds\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For some Earl or Duke in royal favor high,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who might coffers pinch and

his wigwam Powhatan received in state\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0August visitors, inquiring errand there.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When they told him England's monarch wished him

his look, his manner plainly said,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"King of people who are natives in this land\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0White Man covets--mine the power to give or

forest monarch, visage brightening\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As upon the gorgeous robe he fixed his gaze,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with eager fingers felt the texture soft.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Glittering crown he lifted (it was burnished brass!),\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eyed with keen approval, nodding his assent.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Newport tried to make the Werowance kneel--in vain!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indian will not bow, he lowering frowns instead,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until Pocahontas, gliding forth, did place\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hand upon her sire's arm, and whisper low\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Words none other heard but Wahunsunakok--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smiled the haughty warrior then and slowly knelt,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While they put on him the royal robe and crown,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Princess deftly slipped from place the Indian mantle,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raccoon skin, with tails for fringe, exchange of gifts\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which it pleased him to bestow on Brother King\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a token of his favor and esteem.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith with outstretched hands and words of gratitude,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Called to him the maiden, she but shyly came,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spoke in broken English words she knew--\"My Father!\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While he named her tenderly, \"My dearest child,\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gently clasped around her neck the coral chain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leading her to Newport, and in louder tones:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Captain, this the maid who risked her life for mine.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gallantly the Captain bowed and kissed the hand\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the Princess, murmuring praises Pocahontas\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Understood not fully.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then they bade adieu,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Planning to set forth straightway; but Powhatan\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Urged them to remain until the morn and

ends.\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Masterful the tone, backed by the weapon raised--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wily Powhatan was moved to shift his ground,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Waiting squaws he bade to fill with yellow corn\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dozen baskets that were speedy set in row\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Twixt the Werowance and the doughty President.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Parleying ensued, a second plea for guns,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guns and swords; but Smith stood firm, with darkening eye\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Waiting the arrival of his gallant men,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Score of whom were left to break the river's ice,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For 'twas Winter and the fear of \"Starving Time\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was assuaged by courage and by tactics bold\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such as President alone could well employ.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Powhatan with baffled look and stealthy stride\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sudden vanished from the room, leaving squaws.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Side by side the English stood with pointed weapons,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eyes fixed on the open door whence swiftly came\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Savage warriors rushing madly on their prey.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fell the foremost dead; a second leaped and fell;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Halted all at smell of powder, sight of smoke,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turned and fled with superstitions dread o'er-come.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speedily arrived the sailors and the soldiers\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith had summoned.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At his word a guard detailed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Watched the Indians while they carried to the barge\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Baskets piled with corn, provisions dearly bought.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Here will we rest till morning dawns,\" the Captain said,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In this outpost rude well wait the rising of the tide,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Russell, comrade brave, and West, and Percy, too,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stay with me, a guard at door; the rest away!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corn to watch, the stranded barge, the pinnace there.\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Round the open fire they sat them down awhile--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On such gruesome night they had no thought for sleep.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Powhatan now sent a present to the Captain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bracelet to appease the fiery White Man's wrath;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soon some Indians came to bring them venison,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feast they much enjoyed despite their secret doubts.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarce had natives left when through the cabin door\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pocahontas stepped with wild-eyed countenance,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wrung her hands and cried, \"Beware the Powhatans!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seek your ships; my people plot your lives to take--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Would you live, begone from here, no more delay!\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her tears brave Pocahontas could no longer stay.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uprose Smith, advanced in haste to greet the maid--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Guardian Angel! fear not for the White Men's lives;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We

depart.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stay not thou, I pray, since peril lurks for thee,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friend of White Man! to thy teepee hie thee back,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wait and watch and pray, as we shall surely do,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till the night shall pass and come the break of day.\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fare-thee-well, Great Spirit guard thee, Friends!\" she cried--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Back to the Indian village Pocahontas fled.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite her warning and their dread, the Red Men came not;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For they feared the wakeful foe, the magic guns,--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kept in hiding for the time.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At faintest dawn\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0English sought the pinnace, homeward made their way.\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VI.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE PARTING.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the meadow by the brooklet was the wigwam\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the old squaw, Winganameo, who to Matoax\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From her childhood oft had taught the folklore,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tales of olden days beside the roaring ocean\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the White Man's ships were wrecked beside the beach,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where through pine woods roamed at will the stalwart Red Men--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accomacks and Chesapeacks and Potomekes,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tappahannocks,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wangoags,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Payankatankas,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the giants of the North, Sasquesahannocks,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the Roanoaks from the magnolia Southlands.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How they fought and how they were united,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How the Powhatan his mighty rule extended--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All these things the old squaw told the maiden.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the mimosa sat Matoax often,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While she listened to the old squaw's wondrous tales,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0learned from her to trace the beadwork patterns deftly\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the moccasins or on the women's mantles;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But of all the stories Winganameo told her,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None the maiden loved to hear so oft repeated\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the legend of the lost ones of Croatan,[8]\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the island where the blue-eyed children lived.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus it was that Pocahontas heard of English\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long before she looked upon the strange Pale Faces,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dreamed of them as little lower than the angels,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the wisdom of the ages blessed.\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[8]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Refers to the \"Lost Colony of Roanoke, 1587,\" (see Hawk's History of North Carolina).\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the wigwam by the brooklet came the Princess\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oft at evening; told to Winganameo softly\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How the English called her \"Guardian Angel,\" loved her,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gave her presents, daily asked her to their homes.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Winganameo nodded sagely as she listened,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she spoke a word of warning to the Princess:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Let not Pale Face bring unto you sorrow, Matoax;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a mother I have watched you coming, going,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Princess born, 'tis many a warrior would wed you,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better could you find a male among your own;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the Pale Face is not of us, is a stranger;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though he love you, he will leave you for his people,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And his home beyond the sea.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have seen it,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often have I seen it, watched him sail away\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevermore returning.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heed my words, O, Daughter!\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pocahontas listened, but her lips replied not,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All her heart was mirrored\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in her dreaming eyes,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she sat with folded hands beneath the shadow\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of mimosa branches with their pink-hued blossoms\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making fairy canopy above her head.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While they sat together in the twilight hour\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Came to them a messenger direct from Jamestown,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indian hunter, many a mile he'd walked to tell\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To his people that the Wizard brave lay wounded\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unto death within his cabin, nursed by soldiers\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who would take him soon across the sea to England.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pocahontas heard the tidings, listening quiet,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But with bated breath--spoke to Winganameo,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saying, \"We must go, mayhap the Captain needs us.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the old squaw whispered back to her in following,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Unto Jamestown we will go together, Daughter.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So they journeyed onward through the field and forest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the silver moonbeams fitful shadows made\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On their pathway, till they reached the settlers' country,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saw the palisades and houses of the English.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Father,\" cried the Princess, kneeling by the bedside\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the sometime President, who suffering lay--\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Art thou wounded sore, and is it true they say\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That to England thou must go, or life's in
