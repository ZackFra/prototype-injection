Nothing is more disagreeable than to say a line over two, or, it may be, three or four times, and at last not be sure that there are not three or four ways of reading, each as good and as much intended as another. Simplex duntaxat et unum. But you young people think Horace and your uncles old fools.\u2019\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Certainly, my dear sir,\u2019 said I; \u2018that is, I mean, Horace and my uncle are perfectly right. Still, there is an instructed ear and an uninstructed. A rude taste for identical recurrences would exact sing-song from \u201cParadise Lost,\u201d and grumble because \u201cIl Penseroso\u201d doesn\u2019t run like a nursery rhyme.\u2019 \u2018Well, well,\u2019 said my uncle, \u2018sunt certi denique fines, no doubt. So commence, my young Piso, while Aristarchus is tolerably wakeful, and do not waste by your logic the fund you will want for your poetry.\u2019"}
