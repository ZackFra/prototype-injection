{"author": "Joaquin Miller", "title": "In Southern California", "content": "Where the cocoa and cactus are neighbors,\r\nWhere the fig and the fir tree are one;\r\nWhere the brave corn is lifting bent sabres\r\nAnd flashing them far in the sun;\n\r\nWhere maidens blush red in their tresses\r\nOf night, and retreat to advance,\r\nAnd the dark, sweeping eyelash expresses\r\nDeep passion, half hush\u2019d in a trance;\n\r\nWhere the fig is in leaf, where the blossom\r\nOf orange is fragrant as fair,\r\nSanta Barbara\u2019s balm in the bosom,\r\nHer sunny, soft winds in the hair;\n\r\nWhere the grape is most luscious; where laden\r\nLong branches bend double with gold;\r\nLos Angelos leans like a maiden,\r\nRed, blushing, half shy, and half bold.\n\r\nWhere passion was born and where poets\r\nAre deeper in silence than song,\r\nA love knows a love, and may know its\r\nReward, yet may never know wrong.\n\r\nWhere passion was born and where blushes\r\nGave birth to my songs of the South,\r\nAnd a song is a love-tale, and rushes,\r\nUnchid, through the red of the mouth;\n\r\nWhere an Adam in Eden reposes,\r\nI repose, I am glad, and take wine\r\nIn the clambering, redolent roses,\r\nAnd under my fig and my vine."}
