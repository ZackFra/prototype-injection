{"author": "William Wordsworth", "title": "Suggested At Tyndrum In A Storm", "content": " Enough of garlands, of the Arcadian crook,\r\n And all that Greece and Italy have sung\r\n Of Swains reposing myrtle groves among!\r\n 'Ours' couch on naked rocks, will cross a brook\r\n Swoln with chill rains, nor ever cast a look\r\n This way or that, or give it even a thought\r\n More than by smoothest pathway may be brought\r\n Into a vacant mind. Can written book\r\n Teach what 'they' learn? Up, hardy Mountaineer!\r\n And guide the Bard, ambitious to be One\r\n Of Nature's privy council, as thou art,\r\n On cloud-sequestered heights, that see and hear\r\n To what dread Powers He delegates his part\r\n On earth, who works in the heaven of heavens, alone."}
