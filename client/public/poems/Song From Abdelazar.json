{"author": "Aphra Behn", "title": "Song From Abdelazar", "content": "Love in fantastic triumph sat,\r\nWhilst bleeding hearts around him flow'd,\r\nFor whom fresh pains he did create,\r\nAnd strange tyrannic power he shew'd;\r\nFrom thy bright eyes he took his fire,\r\nWhich round about in sport he hurl'd;\r\nBut 'twas from mine he took desire\r\nEnough to undo the amorous world.\n\r\nFrom me he took his sighs and tears,\r\nFrom thee his pride and cruelty;\r\nFrom me his languishments and fears,\r\nAnd every killing dart from thee;\r\nThus thou and I the God have arm'd,\r\nAnd set him up a Deity;\r\nBut my poor heart alone is harm'd,\r\nWhilst thine the victor is, and free.
