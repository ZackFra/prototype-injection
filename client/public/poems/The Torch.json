{"author": "Walt Whitman", "title": "The Torch", "content": "On my northwest coast in the midst of the night, a fishermen's group stands watching;\r\nOut on the lake, that expands before them, others are spearing salmon;\r\nThe canoe, a dim shadowy thing, moves across the black water,\r\nBearing a Torch a-blaze at the prow."}
