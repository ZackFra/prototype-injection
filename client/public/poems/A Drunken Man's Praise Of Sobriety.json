{"author": "William Butler Yeats", "title": "A Drunken Man's Praise Of Sobriety", "content": "Come swish around, my pretty punk,\r\nAnd keep me dancing still\r\nThat I may stay a sober man\r\nAlthough I drink my fill.\n\r\nSobriety is a jewel\r\nThat I do much adore;\r\nAnd therefore keep me dancing\r\nThough drunkards lie and snore.\r\nO mind your feet, O mind your feet,\r\nKeep dancing like a wave,\r\nAnd under every dancer\r\nA dead man in his grave.\r\nNo ups and downs, my pretty,\r\nA mermaid, not a punk;\r\nA drunkard is a dead man,\r\nAnd all dead men are drunk."}
