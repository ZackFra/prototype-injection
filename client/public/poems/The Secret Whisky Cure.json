ordinary boozing, and of dull domestic life,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the everlasting friction that most husbands must endure,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tale of nagging and of drinking, and a secret whisky cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name of Jones, perhaps you know him, small house-agent here in town,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Friend of Smith, you know him also, likewise Robinson and Brown),\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just a hopeless little husband, whose deep sorrows were obscure,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And a bitter nagging Missis, and death seemed the only cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2019Twas a common sordid marriage, and there\u2019s little new to tell,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Save the pub to him was Heaven and his own home was a hell:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the office in between them, purgatory to be sure,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, as far as Jones could make out, well, there wasn\u2019t any cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2019Twas drink and nag, or nag and drink, whichever you prefer,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till at last she couldn\u2019t stand him any more than he could her.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friends and relatives assisted, telling her (with motives pure)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That a legal separation was the only earthly cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So she went and saw a lawyer, who, in accents soft and low,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asked her firstly if her husband had a bank account or no;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he hadn\u2019t and she hadn\u2019t, they in fact were very poor,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he bowed her out suggesting she should try some liquor cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She saw a drink cure advertised in the Sydney Bulletin,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cure for brandy, cure for whisky, cure for rum and beer and gin,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it could be given secret, it was tasteless, swift and sure,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So she purchased half a gallon of that Secret Whisky Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she put some in his coffee, smiling sweetly all the while,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he started for the office rather puzzled by the smile,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smile or frown he\u2019d have a whisky, and you\u2019ll say he was a boor,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But perhaps his wife had given him an overdose of Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he met a friend he hadn\u2019t seen for seven years or more,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was just upon the threshold of a private bar-room door,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And they coalised and entered straight away, you may be sure,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But of course they hadn\u2019t reckoned with a Secret Whisky Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jones, he drank, turned pale, and, gasping, hurried out the back way quick,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where, to his old chum\u2019s amazement, he was violently sick;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then they interviewed the landlord, but he swore the drink was pure,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was only the beginning of the Secret Whisky Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Jones couldn\u2019t stand the smell of even special whisky blends,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And shunned bar-rooms to the sorrow of his trusty drinking friends:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And they wondered, too, what evil genius had chanced to lure\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Him from paths of booze and friendship, never dreaming of a Cure.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had noticed, too, with terror that a something turned his feet,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a pub was near, and swung him to the other side the street,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till he thought the devils had him, and his person they\u2019d immure\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a lunatic asylum where there wasn\u2019t any Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He consulted several doctors who were puzzled by the case,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As they mostly are, but never tell the patient to his face,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some advised him \u2018Try the Mountains for this malady obscure:\u2019\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there wasn\u2019t one could diagnose a Secret Whisky Cure.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And his wife, when he was sober?, Well, she nagged him all the more!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he couldn\u2019t drown his sorrow in the pewter as of yore:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he shot himself at Manly and was sat upon by Woore,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And found rest amongst the spirits from the Secret Whisky Cure.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the moral?, well, \u2019tis funny, or \u2019tis woman\u2019s way with men,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She\u2019s remarried to a publican who whacks her now and then,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And they get on fairly happy, he\u2019s a brute and he\u2019s a boor,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she\u2019s never tried her second with a Secret Whisky Cure."}
