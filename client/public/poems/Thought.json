{"author": "Walt Whitman", "title": "Thought", "content": "As they draw to a close,\r\nOf what underlies the precedent songs of my aims in them;\r\nOf the seed I have sought to plant in them;\r\nOf joy, sweet joy, through many a year, in them;\r\n(For them for them have I lived In them my work is done;)\r\nOf many an aspiration fond of many a dream and plan,\r\nOf you, O mystery great! to place on record faith in you, O death!\r\nTo compact you, ye parted, diverse lives!\r\nTo put rapport the mountains, and rocks, and streams,\r\nAnd the winds of the north, and the forests of oak and pine,\r\nWith you, O soul of man."}
