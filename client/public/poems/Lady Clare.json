{"author": "Alfred Lord Tennyson", "title": "Lady Clare", "content": "It was the time when lilies blow,\r\nAnd clouds are highest up in air,\r\nLord Ronald brought a lily-white doe\r\nTo give his cousin, Lady Clare.\n\r\nI trow they did not part in scorn-\r\nLovers long-betroth'd were they:\r\nThey too will wed the morrow morn:\r\nGod's blessing on the day !\n\r\n'He does not love me for my birth,\r\nNor for my lands so broad and fair;\r\nHe loves me for my own true worth,\r\nAnd that is well,' said Lady Clare.\n\r\nIn there came old Alice the nurse,\r\nSaid, 'Who was this that went from thee?'\r\n'It was my cousin,' said Lady Clare,\r\n'To-morrow he weds vith me.'\n\r\n'O God be thank'd!' said Alice the nurse,\r\n' That all comes round so just and fair:\r\nLord Ronald is heir of all your lands,\r\nAnd you are not the Lady Clare.'\n\r\n'Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse?'\r\nSaid Lady Clare, 'that ye speak so wild?'\r\n'As God's above,' said Alice the nurse,\r\n' I speak the truth: you are my child.\n\r\n'The old Earl's daughter died at my breast;\r\nI speak the truth, as I live by bread!\r\nI buried her like my own sweet child,\r\nAnd put my child in her stead.'\n\r\n'Falsely, falsely have ye done,\r\nO mother,' she said, ' if this be true,\r\nTo keep the best man under the sun\r\nSo many years from his due.'\n\r\n'Nay now, my child,' said Alice the nurse,\r\n'But keep the secret for your life,\r\nAnd all you have will be Lord Ronald's,\r\nWhen you are man and wife.'\n\r\n' If I'm a beggar born,' she said,\r\n'I will speak out, for I dare not lie.\r\nPull off, pull off, the brooch of gold,\r\nAnd fling the diamond necklace by.'\n\r\n'Nay now, my child,' said Alice the nurse,\r\n'But keep the secret all ye can.'\r\nShe said, ' Not so: but I will know\r\nIf there be any faith in man.'\n\r\n'Nay now, what faith ?' said Alice the nurse,\r\n'The man will cleave unto his right.'\r\n'And he shall have it,' the lady replied,\r\n'Tho' I should die to-night.'\n\r\n'Yet give one kiss to your mother dear !\r\nAlas, my child, I sinn'd for thee.'\r\n'O mother, mother, mother,' she said,\r\n'So strange it seems to me.\n\r\n'Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear,\r\nMy mother dear, if this be so,\r\nAnd lay your hand upon my head,\r\nAnd bless me, mother, ere I go.'\n\r\nShe clad herself in a russet gown,\r\nShe was no longer Lady Clare:\r\nShe went by dale, and she went by down,\r\nWith a single rose in her hair.\n\r\nThe lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought\r\nLeapt up from where she lay,\r\nDropt her head in the maiden's hand,\r\nAnd follow'd her all the way.\n\r\nDown stept Lord Ronald from his tower:\r\n'O Lady Clare, you shame your worth!\r\nWhy come you drest like a village maid,\r\nThat are the flower of the earth?'\n\r\n'If I come drest like a village maid,\r\nI am but as my fortunes are:\r\nI am a beggar born,' she said,\r\n'And not the Lady Clare.'\n\r\n'Play me no tricks,' said Lord Ronald,\r\n'For I am yours in word and in deed.\r\nPlay me no tricks,' said Lord Ronald,\r\n'Your riddle is hard to read.'\n\r\nO and proudly stood she up !\r\nHer heart within her did not fail:\r\nShe look'd into Lord Ronald's eyes,\r\nAnd told him all her nurse's tale.\n\r\nHe laugh'd a laugh of merry scorn:\r\nHe turn'd and kiss'd her where she stood:\r\n'If you are not the heiress born,\r\nAnd I,' said he, 'the next in blood--\n\r\n'If you are not the heiress born,\r\nAnd I,' said he, ' the lawful heir,\r\nWe two will wed to-morrow morn,\r\nAnd you shall still be Lady Clare.'
