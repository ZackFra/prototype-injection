{"author": "Edward Dyson", "title": "Cricket Is A Serious Thing", "content": "In politics there\u2019s room for jest;\r\nWith frequent gibes are speeches met,\r\nAnd measures which are of the best\r\nAre themes for caustic humor yet.\r\nE\u2019en though the pulpiteer we fret\r\nWith sundry quiddities we fling,\r\nWe pray you never to forget\r\nThat cricket is a serious thing.\n\r\nThe crowd assembles at a Test,\r\nAnd Hobbs at length is fairly set,\r\nThough Gregory rocks \u2018em in with zest;\r\nThe barrackers may fume and fret\r\nWhen Parkin has contrived to get\r\nFive men of ours, we feel the sting,\r\nAnd give expression to regret,\r\nFor cricket is a serious thing.\n\r\nThey have the lead; we would arrest\r\nA sort of rot.No epithet\r\nIs proper, though they\u2019ve got our best\r\nFor next to nothing, and your bet\r\nIs good as lost.Don\u2019t sit and sweat;\r\nDue reverence to the problem bring.\r\nWe have a pile of runs to net,\r\nAh, cricket is a serious thing."}
