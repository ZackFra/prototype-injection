sense\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of terror in the air.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And all on board the Valdemar\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was still as still could be;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Save when the dismal ship-bell tolled,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As ever and anon she rolled,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And lurched into the sea.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The captain up and down the deck\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Went striding to and fro;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now watched the compass at the wheel,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now lifted up his hand to feel\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which way the wind might blow.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now he looked up at the sails,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now upon the deep;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In every fibre of his frame\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt the storm before it came,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had no thought of sleep.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eight bells! and suddenly abaft,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a great rush of rain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making the ocean white with spume,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In darkness like the day of doom,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On came the hurricane.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lightning flashed from cloud to cloud,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And rent the sky in two;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A jagged flame, a single jet\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of white fire, like a bayonet\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That pierced the eyeballs through.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then all around was dark again,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And blacker than before;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in that single flash of light\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had beheld a fearful sight,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And thought of the oath he swore.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For right ahead lay the Ship of the Dead,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ghostly Carmilhan!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her masts were stripped, her yards were bare,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And on her bowsprit, poised in air,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sat the Klaboterman.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her crew of ghosts was all on deck\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or clambering up the shrouds;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The boatswain's whistle, the captain's hail,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were like the piping of the gale,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And thunder in the clouds.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And close behind the Carmilhan\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There rose up from the sea,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As from a foundered ship of stone,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three bare and splintered masts alone:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They were the Chimneys Three.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And onward dashed the Valdemar\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And leaped into the dark;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A denser mist, a colder blast,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A little shudder, and she had passed\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Right through the Phantom Bark.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She cleft in twain the shadowy hulk,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But cleft it unaware;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As when, careering to her nest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sea-gull severs with her breast\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The unresisting air.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again the lightning flashed; again\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They saw the Carmilhan,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whole as before in hull and spar;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But now on board of the Valdemar\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stood the Klaboterman.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And they all knew their doom was sealed;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They knew that death was near;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some prayed who never prayed before,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And some they wept, and some they swore,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And some were mute with fear.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then suddenly there came a shock,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And louder than wind or sea\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A cry burst from the crew on deck,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she dashed and crashed, a hopeless wreck,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon the Chimneys Three.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The storm and night were passed, the light\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To streak the east began;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cabin-boy, picked up at sea,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Survived the wreck, and only he,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To tell of the Carmilhan.\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INTERLUDE\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the long murmur of applause\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That greeted the Musician's lay\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had slowly buzzed itself away,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the long talk of Spectre Ships\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That followed died upon their lips\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And came unto a natural pause,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"These tales you tell are one and all\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the Old World,\" the Poet said,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Flowers gathered from a crumbling wall,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dead leaves that rustle as they fall;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let me present you in their stead\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something of our New England earth,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A tale which, though of no great worth,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Has still this merit, that it yields\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certain freshness of the fields,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sweetness as of home-made bread.\"\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Student answered: \"Be discreet;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For if the flour be fresh and sound,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if the bread be light and sweet,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who careth in what mill 't was

baked;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wholesome bread of yesterday,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Too stale for them, is thrown away,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is their thirst with water slaked.\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As oft we see the sky in May\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Threaten to rain, and yet not rain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Poet's face, before so gay,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was clouded with a look of pain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But suddenly brightened up again;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And without further let or stay\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He told his tale of yesterday."}
