{"author": "William Wordsworth", "title": "Characteristics Of A Child Three Years Old", "content": "Loving she is, and tractable, though wild;\r\nAnd Innocence hath privilege in her\r\nTo dignify arch looks and laughing eyes;\r\nAnd feats of cunning; and the pretty round\r\nOf trespasses, affected to provoke\r\nMock-chastisement and partnership in play.\r\nAnd, as a faggot sparkles on the hearth,\r\nNot less if unattended and alone\r\nThan when both young and old sit gathered round\r\nAnd take delight in its activity;\r\nEven so this happy Creature of herself\r\nIs all-sufficient, solitude to her\r\nIs blithe society, who fills the air\r\nWith gladness and involuntary songs.\r\nLight are her sallies as the tripping fawn's\r\nForth-startled from the fern where she lay couched;\r\nUnthought-of, unexpected, as the stir\r\nOf the soft breeze ruffling the meadow-flowers,\r\nOr from before it chasing wantonly\r\nThe many-coloured images imprest\r\nUpon the bosom of a placid lake."}
