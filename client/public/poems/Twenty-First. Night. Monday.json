Monday.\r\nSilhouette of the capitol in darkness.\r\nSome good-for-nothing -- who knows why--\r\nmade up the tale that love exists on earth.\n\r\nPeople believe it, maybe from laziness\r\nor boredom, and live accordingly:\r\nthey wait eagerly for meetings, fear parting,\r\nand when they sing, they sing about love.\n\r\nBut the secret reveals itself to some,\r\nand on them silence settles down...\r\nI found this out by accident\r\nand now it seems I'm sick all the time."}
