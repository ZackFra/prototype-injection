Oh! every word\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Falls like a drop of silver, as the strain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In winding sweetness, swells and sinks again.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sing ever thus, beguiling life's long way,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As here, poor pilgrims of the earth, we stray;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, lady, when thy pilgrimage shall end,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And late the shades of the long night descend,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 May sister seraphs welcome with a song,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And gently say, Why have you stayed so long?"}
