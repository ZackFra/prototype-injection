{"author": "Madison Julius Cawein", "title": "Despondency.", "content": " Not all the bravery that day puts on\r\n Of gold and azure, ardent or austere,\r\n Shall ease my soul of sorrow; grown more dear\r\n Than all the joy that heavenly hope may don.\r\n Far up the skies the rumor of the dawn\r\n May run, and eve like some wild torch appear;\r\n These shall not change the darkness, gathered here,\r\n Of thought, that rusts like an old sword undrawn.\r\n Oh, for a place deep-sunken from the sun!\r\n A wildwood cave of primitive rocks and moss!\r\n Where Sleep and Silence, breast to married breast\r\n Lie with their child, night-eyed Oblivion;\r\n Where, freed from all the trouble of my cross,\r\n I might forget, I might forget, and rest!"}
