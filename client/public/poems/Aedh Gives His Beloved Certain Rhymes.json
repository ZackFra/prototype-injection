{"author": "William Butler Yeats", "title": "Aedh Gives His Beloved Certain Rhymes", "content": "Fasten your hair with a golden pin,\r\nAnd bind up every wandering tress;\r\nI bade my heart build these poor rhymes:\r\nIt worked at them, day out, day in,\r\nBuilding a sorrowful loveliness\r\nOut of the battles of old times.\n\r\nYou need but lift a pearl-pale hand,\r\nAnd bind up your long hair and sigh;\r\nAnd all men\u2019s hearts must burn and beat;\r\nAnd candle-like foam on the dim sand,\r\nAnd stars climbing the dew-dropping sky,\r\nLive but to light your passing feet."}
